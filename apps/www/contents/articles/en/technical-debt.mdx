Technical debt is a loan. Every shortcut you take today must be repaid-with interest.

Most teams understand this conceptually. Few understand it viscerally until they're drowning.

## The Compounding Problem

Financial debt compounds monthly. Technical debt compounds with every new feature.

Skip writing tests? Now every change is risky. Skip documentation? Now every new developer is slow. Skip refactoring? Now every feature takes longer than the last.

<Callout type="danger">
The interest rate on technical debt is variable-and it accelerates. A small shortcut taken in month one might cost 10x by month twelve.
</Callout>

## The Types of Debt

### Deliberate Debt

Sometimes shortcuts are strategic. Ship fast, learn, iterate. This is acceptable if:

1. You document what was skipped
2. You plan time to repay it
3. You actually repay it

Most teams fail at step 3.

### Accidental Debt

This is debt from ignorance. The junior developer who doesn't know best practices. The rushed senior who ships without thinking.

Accidental debt is expensive because no one knows it exists until it breaks.

### Bit Rot

Code doesn't stay good. Dependencies update. Browsers change. Security vulnerabilities emerge. Code that was fine last year is a liability today.

Bit rot isn't optional-it's inevitable. The only question is whether you're maintaining or accumulating.
</Quote>

## The Bankruptcy Moment

There's a point where technical debt becomes terminal. Where the cost of change exceeds the value of the system.

You know you're there when:

- Simple changes take weeks
- Deploys are terrifying
- Developers leave rather than deal with the codebase
- The only solution is "rewrite from scratch"

Most rewrites fail. Not because the code is hard-because the organization hasn't changed the behaviors that created the debt.

## How to Avoid Bankruptcy

### Budget for Maintenance

Plan 20-30% of engineering time for debt repayment. Not features. Not bugs. Debt.

Refactoring. Testing. Documentation. Dependency updates. Security patches.

If you're not spending time here, you're accumulating debt.

### Make Debt Visible

Create a debt register. List every known shortcut, hack, or "we'll fix it later" decision.

Review it quarterly. Prioritize. Pay down the highest-interest items first.

### Slow Down to Go Fast

The fastest way to build a system is to build it carefully the first time.

```typescript
// Writing tests feels slow initially
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should validate email format', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('invalid')).toBe(false);
    expect(validateEmail('valid@email.com')).toBe(true);
  });
});

// But it speeds up long-term velocity
```

Tests slow down initial development but speed up long-term velocity. Documentation feels wasteful until someone new joins. Refactoring feels indulgent until you need to change something.

The teams that ship fast in year one are often the teams that can't ship at all by year three.
