Most businesses evaluate development partners wrong. They optimize for cost, speed, or impressive portfolios. Then they're surprised when the project fails.

Here's what actually predicts success.

## Not Portfolio—Process

A beautiful portfolio proves they can build one thing well. It doesn't prove they can build your thing well.

Instead, ask about process:

- How do you handle changing requirements?
- What happens when you disagree with a decision?
- How do you prioritize when everything is urgent?
- What's your approach to technical debt?

Their answers reveal how they think, not just what they've built.

## Not Speed—Velocity

Speed is how fast they start. Velocity is how fast they maintain pace.

Many developers sprint for the first month and crawl by month three. Why? Because they accumulated debt without realizing it.

<Callout type="info">
Ask: How do you maintain velocity over time? What's your approach to refactoring? How do you handle dependency updates?
</Callout>

Partners who talk about sustainability over speed will deliver more in the long run.

## Not Promises—Boundaries

Good developers know their limits. They'll say "I don't know" or "That's not my expertise."

Bad developers promise everything. They'll figure it out along the way (at your expense).

If they haven't said "no" or "I'm not sure" in the sales conversation, they're selling, not consulting.

## Not Technology—Judgment

The tech stack matters less than the reasoning behind it.

A developer who says "We use React because it's popular" is following trends.

A developer who says "We use React because your team already knows it, and onboarding new developers will be faster" is making strategic decisions.

Ask why they choose specific technologies. The quality of their reasoning matters more than the technologies themselves.

## The Red Flags

### They Lead with Tools

If the first thing they talk about is their tech stack, they're technologists, not problem solvers.

Good developers start with questions, not solutions.

### They Don't Ask About Maintenance

If they don't ask who will maintain the system after launch, they're not thinking long-term.

### They Quote Without Discovery

No one can accurately estimate a project without understanding it. Fixed quotes before discovery phase = guaranteed scope creep or cut corners.

### They Don't Talk About Trade-offs

Every technical decision is a trade-off. Speed vs. maintainability. Flexibility vs. simplicity. Cost vs. performance.

If they're not discussing trade-offs, they're not thinking critically.

## The Green Flags

### They Ask About Your Team

They want to know who will work with the system, who will maintain it, and what your team's technical capabilities are.

### They Push Back

They question requirements. They challenge assumptions. They suggest alternatives.

This isn't rudeness—it's rigor.

### They Talk About Constraints

They ask about budget, timeline, and must-haves. They help you prioritize. They tell you what you can't have.

### They Explain Simply

Complex topics explained clearly = deep understanding. Complex topics explained complexly = shallow understanding or gatekeeping.

## The Question to Ask

**"Tell me about a project that went wrong and how you handled it."**

Their answer tells you:

- Whether they're honest (everyone has failures)
- How they handle adversity
- Whether they learn from mistakes
- How they communicate bad news

<Callout type="warning">
If they say they've never had a failed project, they're lying or inexperienced. Either way, walk away.
